Toka (2.0)
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is an update to the Toka language. The words, etc provided
will see only small changes, but the internal design is being
cleaned up, and now makes use of a hybrid bytecode/direct thread
model. (The bytecode is a superset of that recognized by the
Ngaro Virtual Machine).
