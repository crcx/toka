Toka is a programming language that draws on 
my experiences with a variety of languages. 
It's still experimental, so things sometimes 
change significantly with little to no warning. 
Overall it does work suprising well though.

The language has been influenced by my 
experiences with RetroForth, HelFORTH, Factor, 
and other languages. In most respects it shows 
a strong bias towards Forth. It does have some 
extra things (quotes, garbage collection, etc) 
that make programming easier for me.
================================================
BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

1) Run the configuration tool and answer the
   questions.

     ./configure


2) Run "make" then "sudo make install"

   This will put 'toka' into /usr/bin, and 
   create /usr/share/toka, where 'bootstrap.toka'
   will be placed.

   Any optional components you selected will be 
   built and installed as well.
